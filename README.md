# VueTest Sample Project

This is a simple Vue.js sample application demonstrating a multi-step company application form.

The project uses Vue 3 from a CDN and does not require Node dependencies. It includes:

- A multi-page form implemented with Vue Router
- Common form validation with a shared validation rule template
- Basic styling for a richer UI

To run the project open `index.html` in a browser.
